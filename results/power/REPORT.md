# Retrospective Power and Minimum Detectable Effect

Status: **DESIGN DIAGNOSTIC — NORMAL APPROXIMATION TO THE BOOTSTRAP**

Power is the probability of rejecting a zero relative improvement at a
two-sided 0.05 level, given the bootstrap standard error of the paired
relative-loss statistic. It is a design diagnostic, not an observed-effect
post hoc calculation.
