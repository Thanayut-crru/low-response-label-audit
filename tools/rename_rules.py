"""How the released files were renamed: the procedure's former name to RDFL, and the name of the
earlier project the code came from to "legacy".

The rename is a byte-level substitution applied to text files and to paths. It is the only
difference between a released file and the file it came from, with one documented exception
(ADJUSTMENTS) that keeps the random streams of the published run unchanged. The project name and
its replacement have the same length, so no seed or length-dependent value changes. The checker
tools/verify_release.py applies these same rules to the archived originals.
